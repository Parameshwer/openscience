Using the computer database, we included 753 total cases diagnosed at the Ackerman Academy from 2008-2011. Specimens were obtained from 574 females and 179 males with an average age 53.7±16.7 years. A total of 500,432 cases were signed out during the study period. The percentage of GA cases diagnosed in every month was calculated by taking into account the number of diagnosed cases during that month to exclude variation of specimen number throughout the year.</div>
